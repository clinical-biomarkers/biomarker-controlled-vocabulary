Description: BiomarkerKB controlled vocabulary for describing which aspect of
             the entity is being assessed for each biomarker.
Name:        aspect_type.txt
Release:     2026_02_17

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the BiomarkerKB curation system, a biomarker is roughly considered to be a
change in some aspect of an assessed entity. For example, the biomarker
“increased IL6 level” consists of ‘increased’ (the change), ‘IL6’ (the entity),
and ‘level’ (the aspect). This document describes the possible aspect types:

    * level
    * expression
    * sequence variation
    * modification

Each entry consists of the following line codes:

ID   level
AC   AS-0001
DE   A position on a scale measuring intensity, quality, or amount.
UF   Any aspect that is quantified on a scale but for which the precise aspect
UF   is unknown/unstated; may also be used in place of more specific aspects.
HI   level
EQ   Level; NCIT:C25554
EX   increased IL6 level; https://biomarkerkb.org/canonical/AN6278
//

ID   expression
AC   AS-0002
DE   The process of converting a gene's sequence into a mature gene product
DE   (protein or RNA).
UF   When quantifying mRNA or protein levels, usually using a relative scale
UF   (e.g., “3-fold”).
HI   expression
EQ   gene expression; GO:0010467
EX   increased expression of ERBB2; https://biomarkerkb.org/canonical/AN5065
//

ID   sequence variation
AC   AS-0003
DE   For polymers, any difference between the observed order of monomer units
DE   within a polymer chain and the order within a suitably comparable reference
DE   polymer.
UF   Entities that differ when specifically comparing sequences; includes
UF   polymorphisms and mutations of genetic material and proteins.
HI   sequence variation
EQ   sequence_alteration; SO:0001059
EX   presence of rs11571833 mutation in BRCA2;
EX   https://biomarkerkb.org/canonical/AN7363
//

ID   modification
AC   AS-0004
DE   An alteration whereby an input and output differ in a small way.
UF   Polymers that undergo addition or removal of a covalent or non-covalent
UF   attachment to one or more component monomers while the polymer length
UF   is unchanged. For proteins, modifications are co- or post-translational
UF   changes to amino acids. For DNA and RNA, modifications are epigenetic (DNA)
UF   or post-transcriptional (RNA) changes to nucleobases.
HI   modification
EQ   Alteration; NCIT:C28344
EX   AKT1 S473 Phosphorylation; https://biomarkerkb.org/canonical/AN4659
NT   Except in rare cases, this term should not be used directly. Instead, a
NT   specific modification should be indicated.
