# BiomarkerKB Controlled Vocabularies
In the BiomarkerKB curation system, a biomarker is roughly considered to be a change in some aspect of an assessed entity. For example, the biomarker “increased IL6 level” consists of ‘increased’ (the change), ‘IL6’ (the entity), and ‘level’ (the aspect).

This repository houses the documents containing the controlled vocabularies used by the BiomarkerKB project to describe biomarkers.
