Description: BiomarkerKB controlled vocabulary for indicating the type of
             change being observed for each biomarker.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the BiomarkerKB curation system, a biomarker is roughly considered to be a
change in some aspect of an assessed entity. For example, the biomarker
“increased IL6 level” consists of ‘increased’ (the change), ‘IL6’ (the entity),
and ‘level’ (the aspect). This document describes the possible change types:

    * increased
    * decreased
    * presence of
    * absence of
    * differential

Each entry consists of the following line codes:
